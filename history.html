        <h2 class="h2">FOUNDATION. THE FIRST STEPS AND "CAMP D'ALGIRÓS" (1919)</h2>
        <hr class="hrtitle">
        <p>
            
       Football arrived in Valencia through individuals connected to the citrus export industry who had been in Great Britain, where the sport originated. British sailors playing with a ball in the ports of Valencia were also commonly seen. In 1909, with the celebration of the regional exposition, football became popular in the city.<br><br>

        In 1919, a group of football enthusiasts gathered in Valencia and founded Valencia Football Club. Octavio Augusto Milego Díaz became the first president of the club. The first Valencia match was played in Castellón against Gimnástico Valenciano. Over the years, the club had notable players like Montes and Cubells, and achieved participation in the Copa de España in 1923.<br><br>

        Valencia had its first own field at Camp d'Algirós, inaugurated in 1919, and later moved to Camp de Mestalla in 1923. The team attracted a growing number of followers, leading to the search for a new field at Mestalla.</p>
        
    
    
    <h2>MESTALLA: THE NEW SETTING FOR MATCHES</h2>
        <hr class="hrtitle">
        <p>
            
       Ramón Leonarte was the president of Valencia who acquired the land of Mestalla in January 1923. The stadium was inaugurated on May 20, 1923, with a match against Levante U.D. The first coach hired by the club was Anton Fivber in the 1923-1924 season.<br><br> Valencia had to wait three years to join the First Division of the Spanish League. In the 1928-1929 season, Valencia made their league debut with a victory over Oviedo.<br><br> In the 1930-1931 season, the team achieved promotion to the First Division under Fivber's guidance. During the Civil War, the club continued its activity with Josep Rodríguez Tortajada as president.

        <h2>THE PRODIGIOUS DECADE</h2>
        <hr class="hrtitle">
                <p>

        In the 2001/2002 season, Valencia CF won the league title after 31 years. The team had an unbeaten streak of 11 matches and came from behind to win a crucial game against Espanyol. Valencia CF was crowned league champions at La Rosaleda on May 5, 2002.<br><br>

        The following season, 2002/03, Valencia CF had a good start in the league, but the results didn't meet expectations in the end. It served as a warning for the future.

        In the 2003/04 season, Valencia CF missed out on the UEFA Champions League and had to settle for the UEFA Cup. Despite this, the team had an impressive start to the season, securing six consecutive victories against notable teams. In that season, Valencia CF also won the league with record-breaking points, wins, and goals.

        In addition to the league, Valencia CF won the UEFA Cup by defeating Olympique de Marseille. This marked the club's first historic double. They also won the UEFA Super Cup and were named the best team in the world.<br><br>

        The last title obtained by Valencia CF was the Copa del Rey in the 2007/08 season. The team eliminated several important rivals, including FC Barcelona, and won the final against Getafe CF.

        Regarding the club's financial situation, the construction of the new stadium was halted due to a lack of liquidity, leading to a capital increase to avoid bankruptcy. The Fundació Valencia Club de Fútbol became the majority shareholder of the club.
        In the 2011/12 season, Valencia CF came close to reaching two finals but was eliminated in the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Europa League by FC Barcelona and Atlético de Madrid, respectively.

        <h2>THE ARRIVAL OF MERITON HOLDINGS AT VALENCIA CF</h2>
        <hr class="hrtitle">
        <p>
            
       In January 2013, problems arose in meeting the acquired obligations, and after Bankia decided not to refinance the credit granted in 2009, the Fundació Valencia CF decided, in early 2014, to put the majority of shares up for sale due to significant economic problems at the Club. From the outset, Meriton Holdings, led by its owner Peter Lim, showed interest in acquiring the majority of shares of Valencia CF. Their dream was to own a club to compete in the UEFA Champions League, a project that was approved unanimously on May 17, 2014, in the vote of the Fundació Valencia CF's board of trustees. During that season, the 2013-14 season, Valencia CF shone again in European competitions, reaching the semifinals of the UEFA Europa League. In the second leg played at Mestalla, one of the bitterest nights occurred when Sevilla FC secured qualification in the 94th minute, as a prelude to winning the title.<br><br>

        Following that agreement, a process began that culminated on October 24, 2014, when Meriton Holdings signed the share purchase agreement with the Fundació Valencia CF, becoming the majority shareholder of the club. They also reached an agreement with Bankia to refinance the debt of the entity and its Foundation. On December 1, 2014, the Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Valencia CF approved Meriton Holding's entry into the club.<br><br>

        In the 2015-16 and 2017-18 seasons, Valencia CF once again came close to competing for a title, reaching the semifinals against FC Barcelona on both occasions, with Barcelona winning both titles.<br><br>

        The 2018-19 season was unforgettable for Valencia fans. Valencia CF celebrated its Centenary with unforgettable events and an emotional finale where Club legends gathered at Mestalla. The icing on the cake came on May 25, 2019, with the victory in the Copa del Rey final against FC Barcelona. Once again in Seville, this time at the Benito Villamarín stadium, Valencia CF defeated Barcelona 2-1 thanks to goals from Rodrigo Moreno and Kevin Gameiro.</p>
